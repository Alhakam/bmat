# BROT - Building Material Ontology
*This repo has been moved from the original wisib server to github*

An auxiliary ontology for defining bridge examples using the BROT ontology, but can also be used with BOT.

The namespace for BROT terms is `https://w3id.org/bmat#`

The suggested prefix for the BMAT namespace is `bmat`

BMAT is based on the Building Topology Ontology (BOT) and therefore reuses various classes and properties from it.
